            They are a mess of textures, and a myriad of colors. <br>
            From distant lands and different worlds. From noble lines and quiet farms.<br>
            Yet no matter their race, descendance, title or physique,<br>
            In their eyes will be flame.<br>
            And this world will stretch before them like a golden river. <br>
            Their coming as true as the tide on the sand and the sun in the dawn. <br>
            Their path is uncertain, but rest assured. They shall come.”<br>

    <p>In the world of Aurinn, the exact origin of each traveler is quite unique,
        and this special upbringing may afford them certain boons and blessings.
        A token heirloom, curried favor, or even a glint of gold.
        When choosing your origin,
        consider what sort of things you may want or need for your character,
        and what sort of story fits them best.</p>

<h4><u>The Prime:</u></h4>
<div>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">They are the people. From the earth they rose, and by this earth were they shaped. They are the inhabitants of the Prime Material Plane and its many brothers and sisters. Rest assured, humble beginnings have no bearing on bright and promising futures. They are the people. They are modest. They are mighty. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The Prime encompasses the basic origins of most characters. This includes the Prime Material Plane, its siblings, and Aurinn itself. It is typical for the Prime to bear material wealth, as well as have good standing with factions of the realm. However, they are not born with mystic powers outside what is common for magic-wielders.</p>

<h4><u>The Astral Vagrant</u></h4>
<div>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">The astral sea is a realm of immense proportions, and those that live within are vast and varied. It’s not too hard then, to imagine that one among those countless many may find themselves wandering the ceaseless depths of the astral expanse. And so, from this endless stretch of possibility emerges the Vagrant. Whatever their reasons, whatever their story, the Vagrant is here. And they shall seize the day in a fresh new world.</p>
    <br>
    <p>An Astral Vagrant can bear any form of gift, power, or reputation, for their story and origin have no limits to impede them. But be warned, for traversal across the Astral Sea is not a perfected art. Oftentimes, undesirable somethings bleed through, following these trespassers… and bringing their history with them. </p>

<h4><u>The Novaborne</u></h4>
<div>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">In this universe, the stars are fickle and vain, and they’ve found a particularly exciting way to compete over merit and glory. Around every century of time, these celestial bodies send forth a vessel. This offspring, born of star and flame, surges forth in a crystalline cocoon and descends to the material plane. They are the Novaborne, champions of their astral progenitor. Bound to a mortal end and radiant life, these avatars play the pawn in a game between stars. The Novaborne may be keenly aware or completely oblivious to this origin, depending on their parent. Yet one thing is certain: They are beholden to an undying thirst for adventure.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A Novaborne is a star-made adventurer. They often bear innate, shapeable abilities or powerful star-birthed artifacts as a result of their origin, but have difficulty building rapport with local factions, as they are privileged strangers in new lands.</p>

    <h1 class="section">Origin Boons</h1>
    <p>There are four types of Origin Boons, and each can be selected by spending an Origin Point. You have three, use them wisely. You can choose to invest in a number of separate boons, or use them all for a single one. Bear in mind as well that your selected Origin Type determines whether you may or may not select certain boons.</p>
</div>

TODO: Add the boon types, and a + and - button that shows the values as you use them (so the ones you don't have are slightly grayed out)
